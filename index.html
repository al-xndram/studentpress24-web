                    “I wish to argue, in this chapter, against the notion of space. Of all the terms we use to describe
                    the world we inhabit, it is the most abstract, the most empty, the most detached from the realities
                    of life and experience.”
                    </br>
                    Tim Ingold, Against Space: Place, Movement, Knowledge</p>
                <p>
                    Space is everything and nothing at the same time. It is the vessel within which places, specific
                    places, reside. But it is not just places in the physical sense. Places can be spaces for the
                    imaginary and the in-tangible. When we speak, we make places for ourselves in conversation. When we
                    write, we are the architects of virtual, fictitious places, and when we read, we rebuild the design
                    of the writer based on our interpretations. When we listen to music or sounds we visualize places in
                    our mind, places where these sounds take us emotionally, or places where they could have originated.
                    Space is everything and nothing as much as it is tangible and intangible, physical and non-physical.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Marshall McLuhan infamously said, “We shape our tools and they shape us”. This line can also be
                    applied to how we understand social spaces. A Social space, in the broadest sense, is any place
                    tangible or in-tangible, that is conductive of any form of social interaction or behaviour. Social
                    spaces are formed and defined by the participation of their inhabitants. They are shaped by the
                    nature of their inhabitants as much as they’re inhabitants are shaped by the nature of the space. As
                    we try to nudge, decorate, expand and furnish the spaces we inhabit, they will retroactively shape
                    us. By extension, they also shape our approaches to the things we do. It's the nature of the space
                    itself that changes the ways we think and eventually, the actions we take.

                <p>
                    OCAD is the space we collectively occupy, for the purpose of exploring and expanding our creative
                    practices. While we are the agents of what we create, the spaces we use always influence our
                    processes and approaches to our practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let us take the 6th floor of 100 McCaul as an example. It is the main open studio and common space
                    area for graphic design and illustration students. It is a large, open space with long tables and
                    many extension cables hanging from the ceiling. It features a scanner usually found near the West
                    windows, two sinks, and a light table towards the East; but predominantly, the main equipment
                    available are the two (unreliable) printers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tables for our laptops and printers to export our work—as graphic designers at OCAD, this is the
                    workflow that is supported by the space. A laptop is an enclosed space accessible via one pair of
                    hands; it is a space for an individual. While we have long tables to share, the spaces we actually
                    work in are enclosed to ourselves, barred from direct contributions of the peers around us. </p>
                <p>
                    This space and workflow is reflective of the role of the contemporary designer: the designer as an
                    individual creative entity. In the present, our professions demand that we are no longer reliant on
                    anyone else other than our pair of hands and our software. This is our normal, this what is natural,
                    this is what is reflected in the nature of our spaces; but in reality, this is far from the norm of
                    the profession.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the longest time, graphic design has been nothing other than interdependent. Before the advent
                    of the digital revolution and design softwares, every layout, every photograph, every custom
                    letterform, every kerned pair and every measurement, everything was processed, calculated, and
                    completed by hand. With work so extensive and laborious, there was no conceivable option other than
                    interdependence. It allowed for their minds to intersect and their ideas to dance, and the result
                    were workflows that resulted in mosaics of community. This mosaic was the space where all these
                    creatives and specialists could coexist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The profession has traded the necessity for community in exchange for speed, accessibility and
                    efficiency. We are instructed to work in individual spaces rather than ones dependent on
                    coexistence. This is why, in essence, 100m is nothing more than an attempt to create space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the aftermath of the digital revolution I find myself in a metaphorical "Times Square". No one is
                    making eye contact with each other as we are surrounded by and bombarded by constant information. To
                    accommodate this overwhelm of information distribution, we as creatives are instructed to match this
                    acceleration with our individual workflows. Now that the creative process is as efficient as it can
                    be with the help of Adobe, you can make more work! You can make it faster, so you should make it as
                    fast as you can!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Us as creatives that long for the natural flow of interdependent making are scattered amidst the
                    rushing traffic of this Times Square. In the midst of it, we are trying to recall and imagine a
                    space of mutual care and co-operation which seeks a longevity within itself, an environment of
                    concentrated work, an environment of failures and experimentations, all of which construct the
                    anthesis to the accelerationism produced by the proposition of the designer as an individual.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If space shapes its inhabitants then its inhabitants can also shape space. So in this age of mass
                    media distribution, of fast-paced production, we are trying to build a little safe space— a
                    slow-paced, interdependent space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    100m is an attempt to make that space for ourselves, not for any purpose other than to give
                    ourselves a moment to breathe. And we welcome, with open arms, anyone who also wants a moment to
                    rest.
                </p>
